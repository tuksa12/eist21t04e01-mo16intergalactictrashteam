    *  -2[A] key input is properly processed (requires simulation from javafx)
    *  -3[A] planets stationary, debris moving
    *  -4[A] acceleration and stirring of the spacecraft
    *  -5[A] stopping the game (requires stop button pressed simulation from javafx), test continuation in case of negative
    *      dialog; same idea for the start game button
    *  -6[A] test object list size: do objects that float off screen get removed from the object list
    *  -7[A] mock projectile testing shooting functionality
    *  -[B] game over when space craft crashes into planet
    *  -[B] evaporation of debris
    *  -[B] spacecraft - debris collisions
    *  -[B] mock projectile test debris splitting
    *  -[C] objects behave correctly according to gravity
